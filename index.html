                Use this space to tell me a little bit about yourself! What is your name? Graduation year? Why are you taking this class and what experience do you already possess related to this course? Please include a picture of yourself in the container to the left.
                My name is Dan Collins, class of 2026. I am taking this class to learn more about engineering and design tools and software. I have some experience with coding and making things with computer-driven manufacturing tools.

                This is Brandon's cat, Howie. Brandon used this picture as an example of how to insert images into a webpage. This picture is adorable, so I left it in.

                You may also notice that the first image of Howie is a vertical orientation whereas the second photo is horizontal. Take a look at the code and the class of each image. The CSS is written such that you specify the orientation of the image to ensure it fills the whole square! You're welcome!

                Lastly, this is to show you how to create a section of text with no images. Once again, you may add to this section, or delete it entirely. I can keep typing and typing and typing and the text will automatically create a newline as needed!
